# DynamicCellSize

This repository contains the codes, data, and simulation results for the work [*Dynamic proteome trade-offs regulate bacterial cell size and growth in fluctuating nutrient environments*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-04865-4). Each figure can be recreated using the corresponding Jupyter Notebook. The single-cell volume trajectories generated for the paper are also included (under Simulation Results), as well as the experimental data used to test the model. Please see the paper for experimental data references.
